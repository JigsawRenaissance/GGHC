\section qspy_4_1_06 Version 4.1.06 (Product) Release date: Feb 09, 2011

This is the intial standalone release of the QSPY host application.
QSPY is still available in the QP/C and QP/C++ distributions, but
other rapid prototyping platforms (such as mbed or Arduino) do not
use the standard QP distributions and have no easy access to the
QSPY tool. For these users, this pre-compiled standalone release
is more convenient.
